# FiveMGunJam
Standalone Gun Jam script with bypass

This is a simple custom script designed to modify the standard functionality of firearms. This script allows players to experience a more realistic environment by randomly jamming the firearm based on a low chance. The script causes weapons to malfunction at unpredictable moments during gameplay. Lastly, their is a bypass for users that you want to not be affected by the gunjam.

Add the bypass into the server.cfg like "add_ace group.whatever perkogunjam.bypass allow"
